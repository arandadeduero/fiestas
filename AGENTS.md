# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the standalone Fiestas Patronales de Aranda de Duero 2026 experience. Source data lives in `src/data/fiestas-2026/events.json`. Nunjucks templates are in `src/templates/`, page styles in `src/styles/`, and browser modules in `src/scripts/`. The generated site is written to `dist/` and should not be edited by hand.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install`: install Nunjucks, Tailwind, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer.
- `npm run build`: generate `/fiestas-2026/`, event detail pages, CSS, JS, sitemap, and robots files.
- `npm run dev`: build once and serve the output at `http://127.0.0.1:8002/fiestas-2026/`.
- `npm run clean`: remove generated `dist/` output.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use ES modules and two-space indentation in JavaScript, Nunjucks, and CSS. Keep event ids lowercase and URL-safe, matching the detail path pattern `/fiestas-2026/e/<id>/`. Prefer descriptive data fields over template-only conditionals.

## Testing Guidelines

Two suites, wired to git hooks so they run on their own (`npm install` points
`core.hooksPath` at `scripts/hooks/`):

- `npm test` — unit tests with `node --test`: pure functions (ICS export, plan
  storage, analytics) plus source-level checks such as the pinned Leaflet SRI
  hashes and the per-job workflow permissions. Takes about a second, and runs on
  every commit via `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`.
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end suite in `tests/e2e/`, on Chromium
  desktop and Chromium mobile. Takes a couple of minutes, and runs before every
  push via `scripts/hooks/pre-push`, which rebuilds `dist/` first because
  Playwright serves what is on disk, not what is in `src/`.

Escape hatches, for when you know what you are doing: `git commit --no-verify`,
`git push --no-verify`, or `SKIP_E2E=1 git push`.

The end-to-end suite never reaches the network. External hosts (`unpkg.com`,
`api.arandadeduero.es`, the CARTO basemaps, remote posters) are intercepted in
`tests/e2e/fixtures.js`, and any request to a host that is not stubbed fails the
test. Leaflet is served from `node_modules/leaflet`, byte-identical to the copy
on unpkg, so the pinned SRI hashes are verified for real.

If Playwright has no browser build for your system (for example macOS 13), point
it at a browser you already have. Set it once per clone, so the hooks pick it up
too without exporting anything:

~~~bash
git config fiestas.playwrightChannel chrome
~~~

`PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome npm run test:e2e` works too, for a one-off run. Skip
both if `npx playwright install chromium` works on your system.

The hooks are local, so they only protect the machine that installed them. The
deploy workflow runs `npm test` before building, which is the one check that
also applies to work that never touched a local hook.

Still worth a manual pass before publishing, because the suite does not cover
it: visual layout and dark mode, the PWA install prompt on a real device, the
share sheet, and calendar downloads landing correctly in a calendar app.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use short imperative commit messages, for example `Extract fiestas standalone build`. Pull requests should describe the user-facing change, include verification steps, and attach screenshots for layout or responsive changes.

## URL Policy

Keep Fiestas 2026 routes local. Links to the rest of Eventos de Aranda de Duero must be absolute with base `https://eventos.arandadeduero.es/`.
